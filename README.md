# Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)

This repository contains re-runs of the simulations from the paper _Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)_ (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560) but based on more recent GW detector observing scenarios from https://github.com/lpsinger/observing-scenarios-simulations.
